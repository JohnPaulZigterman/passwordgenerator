# Password Generator - John Zigterman

## Description

- My goal was to implement javascript in a manner that allowed users to generate passwords as requested.
- Set a series of prompts upon button press that take in what data the user would like implemented in password.
- Set a prompt that determines password length.
- Defined four character libraries from which to choose.
- Designed a series of functions to properly concatenate libraries and select characters from them.

## Installation

This is a web page and can be viewed using any web browser.

## Usage

The application can be used to generate secure passwords within a set of user defined parameters.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
